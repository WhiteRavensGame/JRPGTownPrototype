Fire Elemental

You head into the Blacksmith’s shop and nearby the forge is a small, dancing flame that drifts back and forth. 
Adelaine: “Hey Mayor! Look, it’s a fire elemental! Got in this morning and saw this little guy dancing around by the forge. I think it thinks it’s its mom! Can we keep it? Please? I promise I won’t let it burn down the town when it gets older!”
