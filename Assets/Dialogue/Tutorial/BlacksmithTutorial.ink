Adelaine Sharp: Hello, and welcome to Sharp’s Handle! Hehe, sorry Mayor, I know you’re not just a random customer, I just like saying that. The shop’s been here before me and I sure intend to have it stay after me. No offense, but the town would be lost without our tools. Plus, with the war coming up, we’ll need weapons as well, to equip our militia! So you better get me some people to help, because I’ll do my best but I’ve only got two arms! Roe over at the mine keeps me supplied with the materials I need but uhm… Do remind them, yeah? They get forgetful.
	#The smithy produces gold and boosts your production of militia. It needs citizens to run it, and materials that come from the Mine.
