Oscar Herring: Shh. You’ll scare the fish. My purpose here is to deliver food to the town and the inn. Honest work. Get me some people, quiet ones, if you want this place to run smooth. Now go, don’t trip on the net. I almost got a bite. Can feel it.
#The fishery provides food for the town. It needs citizens to run it.
