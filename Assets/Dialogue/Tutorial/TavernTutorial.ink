Will Van Merrin: Welcome, esteemed mayor! And welcome to the Bottom’s Cup Inn. Best Inn this side of Valguard! And, well, yes, I know, the only one. I know I haven’t been here long, so I really want you to know how grateful I am for your welcoming me in such dire times of war and famine. Not only am I going to make sure this inn brings the town, and me, of course, the kind of wealth it’s never seen before, but I guarantee that it will bring cheer and light-heartedness ot the whole of the town!
	I only require a few volunteers to help me run it (everyone will be duly paid, of course), as well as an income of food from the fishery! I’m sure that would be no issue to provide for an exceptional mayor such as you!
	#Will’s Inn, Bottom's Cup Inn, will bring the town gold, as well as morale. It runs thanks to the citizens you assign to it, and the fish from the fishery.
